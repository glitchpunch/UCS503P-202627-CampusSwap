# CampusSwap: Hostel Room Exchange

CampusSwap helps hostel students move to a room they like better, by finding
**chains of swaps** where everyone involved ends up somewhere they prefer.
It uses the **Top Trading Cycles (TTC)** algorithm, which can find 3-way and
4-way chains (A takes B's room, B takes C's, C takes A's) that are almost
impossible to spot by hand in WhatsApp groups.

## What the prototype does

The proposal defines Phase 1 success as *accepting a request, saving it to the
database, running a match, and showing the result*. The prototype does all four,
with real data, plus the confirmation step planned for Phase 2.

1. **Log in** as a student or as hostel staff (the warden).
2. **Feature 1: submit a ranked request.** A student browses rooms in the
   hostels they are allowed to live in, ranks up to 5, and gets a tracking ID.
3. **Feature 2: run a matching round.** The warden runs TTC over every open
   request, sees each chain it found and the **Match Yield** (the share of
   students matched), and can compare it with direct 1:1 swaps on the same pool.
4. **Confirm and approve.** Every student in a chain confirms or declines within
   48 hours; once all confirm, the warden approves and the rooms change hands.

## Try it in two minutes

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r code/backend/requirements-dev.txt
.venv\Scripts\python code/backend/run.py --reset
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. Every demo account uses the password `campus123`:

| Account | Who |
|---|---|
| `warden@thapar.edu` | Hostel staff (admin) |
| `student1@thapar.edu`, `student2@...`, `student3@...` | Students with no request yet, in Hostel M rooms A-101, B-101 and A-201 |

All names, roll numbers and emails in the demo data are made up.
